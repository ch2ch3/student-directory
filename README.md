Student Directory
=================

This is the first project at Makers Academy, which familiarises us with the tools of the tradeâ€”the command line, working in Sublime, version control with Git, and basic Ruby.

The script allows you to manage students enrolled at Makers Academy. It stores each student's name, cohort, age, hobby, and country. Through an interactive menu, you can show the list of students, input new students, save the list to a CSV file, or load an existing CSV file.

How to use 
----------
Clone the repository:
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:ch2ch3/student-directory.git
```

Run the script:
```shell
$ ruby student-directory/directory.rb
```

You should see the following:
```shell
Enter the menu number of the function you want to access.
1. Input the students
2. Show the students
3. Save the list
4. Load an existing list
9. Exit
```

To input the students, press "1" and then Enter. For other functions, press the corresponding number of the menu item.
